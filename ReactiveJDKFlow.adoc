= Notes on implementing https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3429[RESTEASY-3429]

The current reactive API's and implementations that rely on reactivestreams need to be deprecated. These can be moved
into a new project or into resteasy-rxjava2.

There is already a `jakarta.ws.rs.client.RxInvokerProvider` which we really should be using instead of some custom
API.

== Implementing Flow.Publisher

To implement the `java.util.concurrent.Flow.Publisher` we'll want to use something SmallRye Mutiny. This will need to
be a separate module. We may want to return a `Uni` and/or `Multi` instead of a publisher directly. Some research
needs to be done here.

There is a start on this implementation using Mutiny. However, it needs a lot more work and some tests. We'll need
to create a new module for this in the feature pack.
